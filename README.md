# Wecare


I have developed a mediation platform that helps parents easily connect with childcare providers.
I’m building the front end using React, integrating with the NodeJS backend deployed on AWS Cloud Services, and maintaining the application data on MongoDB.

 ● Optimizes and makes treatment personnel accessible in the field of child development
 
 ● Helping therapists build themselves as an independent business
